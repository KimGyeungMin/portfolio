          <p class="forest_doc">When forests are destroyed, the topsoil flows down by rain, making it difficult to regenerate rainforests. Some rainforests grow 4-5m per year, but unlike temperate forests, trees that are beneficial for forestry take 100 years for natural forests to recover. In 1980, the total area of ​​the tropical forest was 1.93 billion hectares, accounting for 7% of the land. Of these, about 1.2 billion hectares are rainforests. However, it is currently reduced by about 18 million hectares per year, and it is expected to decrease by 40% in 2010. There are three reasons for the decline: commercial timber felling, new coal ash felling, and fire farming, which is different from the conventional type. Rainforests, also known as the Earth's'green lungs', absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, release oxygen, and purify the atmosphere.</p>
          <p class="forest_doc">The extinction of the rainforest means that these lungs cease to function. As carbon dioxide increases, the impact on the climate cannot be ignored. In addition, the possibility of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts increases along with global warming. It is also calculated that the Amazon alone is responsible for a third of the planet's oxygen balance. In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, decided to respond internationally by adopting the principles of forest conservation, but the country is facing difficulties due to various circumstances.</p>

        <p class="air__doc">In the billions of years of Earth's history, in the very short two centuries humans have transformed the global environment. Among them, the biggest problems are the instability of food supply due to climate change, deterioration of forests causing air pollution or acid rain, and the impact on humans and ecosystems by released chemical pollutants.</p>
        <p  class="air__doc">The six elements of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur account for 95% of living organisms, and each organism has maintained life by efficiently circulating these elements. Recently, this material cycle has begun to change, especially carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Fossil fuels consumed from 1860 to the present have released 185 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p  class="air__doc">The annual emission has increased by 50 times from 93 million tons in 1860 to 5 billion tons. In the early 20th century, large amounts of carbon were released into the atmosphere by burning forests for firefighting or to create pastures. The total from 1860 to the present amounted to more than 100 billion tons. As a result, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by about 30%. Carbon dioxide was seen as the main culprit of global warming.</p>
        <p  class="air__doc">Carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere has been warned since around 1900, but methane and nitrogen compounds are recently attracting attention as greenhouse gases. Nitrogen compounds (NOx), which are discharged in large quantities from thermal power plants, automobiles, and factories, react with other compounds when exposed to strong sunlight to generate ozone. Ozone is the main component of photochemical smog occurring in many cities, and this pollutant is now moving to gardens, causing further damage.</p>
        <p  class="air__doc">Acid rain, which is related to sulfur and nitrogen compounds, has also shifted from the problem of some cities to regional problems, and the problem is now taking a globalization pattern. Asbestos (asbestos), known as a non-combustible fiber, has also been found to increase in Antarctic glaciers, indicating that pollution is progressing on a global scale. As such, it can be said that there are many undisclosed pollutions due to the mixing of various pollutants in the atmosphere.</p>

        <p class="climateRise_list">It has announced that global warming is causing regional impacts. The effects of global warming include an increase in global temperature, sea level rise, changes in precipitation and patterns, and expansion of subtropical desert regions. In addition, global warming has resulted in a reduction in Arctic and continuous reduction of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Other effects of global warming include extreme climates and increased heatwaves, droughts and heavy rains, ocean acidification and species extinction. In human life there is a decline in agricultural yields and the outbreak of climate change refugees.</p>
        <p class="climateRise_list">The pre-spring period in regional ecosystem systems and changes in plant and animal domains to the polar regions are highly correlated with recent global warming. Future climate change is expected to have a major impact on certain ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves and coral reefs. Most ecosystems are expected to be affected by high carbon dioxide concentrations and high global temperatures. Overall, climate change is expected to lead to reduced ecosystem diversity and extinction of many species.</p>
        <p class="climateRise_list">Climate change and human impacts are more affected by extreme climate change than by gradual climate change. The effects of climate change so far have minor but distinct effects on indigenous threats and human health in high latitude regions, including adverse effects on small islands. In the 21st century, climate change is projected to affect millions of people with coastal retreat, floods, water declines and poor health. Most economics papers mention that global warming causes a loss of GDP.</p>
